Bank Loan Analysis Using SQL and PowerBI-

The Bank Loan Report project aims to create a comprehensive and insightful overview of the bank's lending activities and performance. The report is organized into three dashboards:

1.	Summary Dashboard:
•	Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) include Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, Total Amount Received, Average Interest Rate, and Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI).
•	Good Loan and Bad Loan KPIs distinguish between loans with 'Fully Paid' and 'Current' status as good loans and 'Charged Off' status as bad loans.
•	Loan Status Grid View provides a detailed breakdown of metrics based on different loan statuses.

2.	Overview Dashboard 
•	Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart) visualize variations in Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, and Total Amount Received over time.
•	Regional Analysis by State (Filled Map) identifies lending metrics by state to assess regional disparities.
•	Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart) depicts loan statistics based on different terms.
•	Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart) illustrates how lending metrics are distributed among borrowers with different employment lengths.
•	Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart) provides insights into loan metrics based on stated purposes.
•	Home Ownership Analysis (TreeMap) displays loan metrics categorized by different home ownership statuses.

3.	Details Dashboard
•	A consolidated view offering detailed insights into key loan-related metrics, borrower profiles, and loan performance.
•	Serves as a one-stop solution for users seeking comprehensive information about the loan portfolio.

•	These dashboards aim to empower the bank with data-driven decision-making, strategic planning, and a holistic understanding of its lending operations.
